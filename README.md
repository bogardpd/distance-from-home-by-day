# Distance from Home by Calendar Day

This script parses hotel stay data from an Excel spreadsheet, and generates an SVG XY scatter chart showing every calendar day (from 1 Jan to 31 Dec) on the X axis, and distance from home on the Y axis, with points colored by year. An average distance from home for each day is also shown.
